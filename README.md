GT IOT Webinari Demo

This is a demo project for showing registration of IoT device to Azure IoT Hub using Device Provisioning Service (DPS). 
Code is cobbled together in short time and for now at least (2015-05-15), has no quality to speak of. Its main purpose is to
show usage of DPS service, setting and reporting Device Twin properties and show usage telemetry publishing.
